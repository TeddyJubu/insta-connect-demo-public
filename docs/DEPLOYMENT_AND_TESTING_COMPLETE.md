   - Create runbooks for common operations
   - Document disaster recovery procedures

### Stage 4 Planning

**Next Stage:** Frontend & User Experience

**Tasks:**
1. Migrate to React/Next.js framework
2. Improve error and empty-state messaging
3. Add guided onboarding flow
4. Localize strings (optional)

**Recommendation:** Start with Next.js for:
- Built-in routing and API routes
- Server-side rendering
- Easy deployment
- Great developer experience
