    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This demo application (&ldquo;Service&rdquo;) connects a Facebook Page and Instagram account using the Meta Graph API. It is operated by Syeed Md. Jobayer solely for demonstration and evaluation purposes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information We Receive</h2>
      <p>When you authorize the Service, Meta shares OAuth access tokens and basic Page or Instagram Business Account details. No personal profile data is requested.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Page metadata (name and ID)</li>
        <li>Instagram Business Account metadata (username and ID)</li>
        <li>Webhook events that you have explicitly enabled in Meta</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>The Service only uses the received data to demonstrate login state, list connected assets, and confirm webhook delivery. Data is not sold, licensed, or shared with third parties.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Storage &amp; Retention</h2>
      <p>Tokens and asset metadata are kept in transient, in-memory storage while the server is running. Restarting the Service clears this data. Webhook payloads are written to application logs for troubleshooting and are automatically rotated by the host; logs are typically retained for no longer than 30 days.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>OAuth secrets and verify tokens are stored in environment variables on the server. HTTPS is enforced for all public endpoints, and only authorized operators have shell access to the infrastructure.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <p>You can remove the integration at any time by revoking the app&rsquo;s permissions from your Meta Business settings. If you need us to delete any residual log data sooner, contact us using the details below.</p>
    </section>
